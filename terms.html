            <h3>1. Terms</h3>

            <p>By accessing the website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greathearts.community">http://www.greathearts.community</a>,
                you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree
                that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of
                these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this
                website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

            <h3>2. Termination</h3>

            <p>
                We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
                for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
                All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive
                termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity
                and limitations of liability.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Disclaimer</h3>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>The materials on Great Hearts Initiatives' website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Great Hearts
                    Initiatives makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other
                    warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability,
                    fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of
                    rights.
                </li>
                <li>Further, Great Hearts Initiatives does not warrant or make any representations concerning the
                    accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise
                    relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. Limitations</h3>

            <p>In no event shall Great Hearts Initiatives or its 3rd party partners be liable for any damages
                (including, without
                limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use
                or inability to use the materials on Great Hearts Initiatives' website, even if Great Hearts
                Initiatives or a Great Hearts Initiatives authorized representative has been notified orally or in
                writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
                implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
                limitations may not apply to you.</p>

            <h3>5. Accuracy of materials</h3>

            <p>The materials appearing on Great Hearts Initiatives' website could include technical, typographical, or
                photographic errors. Great Hearts Initiatives does not warrant that any of the materials on its website
                are accurate, complete or current. Great Hearts Initiatives may make changes to the materials contained
                on its website at any time without notice. However Great Hearts Initiatives does not make any commitment
                to update the materials.</p>

            <h3>6. Links</h3>

            <p>Our Service may contain links to third­party web sites or services that are not owned or controllKed
                by Great Hearts Initiatives.</p>

            <p>Great Hearts Initiatives has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the
                content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further
                acknowledge and agree that Great Hearts Initiatives shall not be responsible or liable,
                directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection
                with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such
                web sites or services.</p>

            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements
